A platform game designed using Unreal Engine 5, programmed entirely with Blueprints.

Designed game levels and scenes with a simple layout and introduced four types of traps:

Spike traps that inflict direct damage.
Flame traps that intermittently ignite and extinguish.
Drop traps that fall at regular intervals.
Bumpers traps that provide a bouncing effect.

Implemented basic player functionality, including binding fundamental animation blueprints. Players can jump, move freely in their field of view, and initiate a sprint by pressing the corresponding keys.

Additionally, an attack feature has been incorporated, allowing players to shoot arrows (which disappear after 2 seconds). After reaching a certain number of attacks, players can unleash special arrows (larger in size).

Player's primary attributes include health and energy. When health reaches zero, the player dies and respawns from the beginning automatically. If energy is depleted, the player cannot continue running and must wait for a certain period for it to replenish automatically.

AI enemies feature basic AI logic, allowing them to patrol automatically and giving chase when they detect the player within their field of vision.
